Full Forest Base Miniaddon
==========================

Can't tell for sure what exactly I was doing here... probably wanted to integrate in into CompleteRC, but there were some issues with tiles. Looks like I fixed some of them, but, unfortunately, I completely forgot what exactly was done and what have to be done.

In that file remained following list:

* Adds CCS wall, tower and gates + road end to Full Forest Base Tileset
* Adds missing raised edge terrains and their edges
* 2DO
* Add normal mini-maps

But it isn't that helpful. Probably it will remain here forever :)
