<h3>What is NwnMdlComp?</h3>
<p>NwnMdlComp is a model compiler and decompiler for Bioware's Neverwinter
Nights game. It allows content providers to extract binary models from NWN and
convert them to human readable ASCII format.&nbsp; The ASCII format is the
format commonly supported by model editing plugins.&nbsp; NwnMdlComp also
supports the recompilation of these ASCII models back into binary form.</p>

<h3>Why Should You Compile Your Models?</h3>
<p>To be perfectly honest, there aren't any significantly compelling reasons to
compile models into binary form.&nbsp; If you look in your override directory
included with the game, most if not all of those models are in ASCII format.&nbsp;
However, there are some good reasons to compile modes.</p>
<p><i>Compiled models load faster.&nbsp; </i>Internally all models must be in
binary form to be usable by the game.&nbsp; In the case of ASCII models, they
are compiled &quot;on the fly&quot; by NWN as needed.</p>
<p><i>Compiled models use less memory and fragment memory less.</i>&nbsp;
Although Bioware might have taken steps to reduce the memory footprint of ASCII
models compiled &quot;on the fly&quot;, I really question if they would have gone to all
the trouble.&nbsp; If Bioware doesn't serialize the core model data in a
compiled model into a single data buffer, then the compiled model would be
scattered through out memory in many different regions of allocated memory.&nbsp;
All these extra memory allocations do require memory overhead.&nbsp; (geek
alert) Also, having parts of the model scattered throughout memory does increase
the chance of page faults from either the free or modified page lists.&nbsp;
Even worse, it could result in the dreaded hard fault. </p>
<p><i>BUT</i> in all seriousness, I doubt either of these two points are serious
enough to even raise a single hair on an eyebrow.&nbsp; Compiling your models
should help performance.&nbsp; But don't expect your modules to suddenly start
running like a bat out of hell.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>DO NOT</b> compile the ASCII models in the override directory to try to
improve your game performance.&nbsp; It won't help and you might screw up the
game.</p>
<h3>Running NwnMdlComp</h3>
<p>NwnMdlComp is a command line program.&nbsp; Thus, it doesn't have any fancy
window interface.&nbsp; If you wish, you can copy &quot;nwnmdlcomp.exe&quot; into your
window's directory.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>Usage:
nwnmdlcomp [-cdxe] [-t#] infile [outfile]

infile - name of the input file.
outfile - name of the output file.
-c - Compile the model (default)
-d - Decompile the model (can't be used with -c)
-x - Extract model from NWN data files (not done yet)
-n - When compiling, don't remove empty faces
-e - Disable appended extension mode. Only usable when an
     output file name or path is specified or extracting
     files from the NWN data files using -x.
-t1 - Perform a decompilation test on all Bioware models
-t2 - Perform a decomp/recomp test on all Bioware models (absolute)
-t3 - Perform a decomp/recomp test on all Bioware models (relative)
-t4 - Perform a decomp/recomp test on all Bioware models (smoothing)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>NwnMdlComp supports two basic modes, compilation and decompilation.</p>
<p>To convert a model from binary to ASCII, use the following command:</p>
<pre>NWNMDLCOMP -d c_bugbeara</pre>
<p>This assumes that there exists a file called &quot;c_bugbeara.mdl&quot; in the current
directory.&nbsp; To convert a model stored in the Bioware data files to ASCII,
add the &quot;-x&quot; option.</p>
<pre>NWNMDLCOMP -dx c_bugbeara</pre>
<p>In both these cases, a file called &quot;c_bugbeara.mdl.ascii&quot; will be created in
the current directory.</p>
<p>To compile an ASCII model, use the following command:</p>
<pre>NWNMDLCOMP -c c_bugbeara</pre>
<p>In this case, the file called &quot;c_bugbeara.mdl.ascii&quot; will be compiled and the
results saved in the file &quot;c_bugbeara.mdl&quot;.</p>
<p>If your ASCII model file doesn't end in &quot;.mdl.ascii&quot; then you will need to
specify the extension of the model file.</p>
<p>For example, let us say that your model editing program saves the ASCII model
under the name &quot;mymodel.mdl&quot;.&nbsp; To compile the model, you would use the
following command.</p>
<pre>NWNMDLCOMP -c mymodel.mdl</pre>
<p>In this case, the file &quot;mymodel.mdl&quot; will be compiled and the results saved
as &quot;mymodel.mdl.bin&quot;.&nbsp; Please note that if the model doesn't end in &quot;.mdl.ascii&quot;,
then &quot;.bin&quot; is appended to the input file name in order to create an output file
name.&nbsp; The binary model will not be saved as &quot;mymodel.mdl&quot; to prevent the
source file from being overwritten.&nbsp; However, if you wish to store your
compiled models in another directory, you can do the following.</p>
<pre>NWNMDLCOMP -c mymodel.mdl compiled/mymodel.mdl</pre>
<p>This will create a file called &quot;mymodel.mdl&quot; in the &quot;compiled&quot; directory.&nbsp;
The directory must already exist.</p>
<h3>Using NwnMdlComp with Wildcards</h3>
<p>NnwMdlComp supports the using of wildcards in the input file name. Standard
wildcards such as &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot; are fully supported.&nbsp;
Wildcards can be used when compiling or decompiling models stored on disk or
stored in the Bioware data files.</p>
<pre>NWNMDLCOMP -dx *</pre>
<p>This command will decompile all the models in the Bioware data files and
store the output in the current directory.</p>
<pre>NWNMDLCOMP -dx * ascii\</pre>
<p>This command will decompile all the models in the Bioware data files and
store them in the &quot;ascii&quot; subdirectory.&nbsp; Make sure this directory
has been created.</p>
<pre>NWNMDLCOMP -ce ascii\*.mdl binary\</pre>
<p>This command will compile all the models in the subdirectory &quot;ascii&quot;
and store the output in the &quot;binary&quot; subdirectory.&nbsp; Another
command line option has also been specified.&nbsp; The &quot;e&quot; option will
tell the model compiler to not use the normal extensions that are appended to
the output file names.&nbsp; Thus, in this command example, if the ascii
subdirectory contained a model called &quot;c_bugbear.mdl&quot;, then instead of
the output being &quot;c_bugbear.mdl.bin&quot; in the binary subdirectory, the
output would be &quot;c_bugbear.mdl&quot; in the binary subdirectory.&nbsp; This
&quot;e&quot; option can also be used when extracting models from the Bioware
data files.</p>
<pre>NWNMDLCOMP -dxe *</pre>
<p>This command will decompile all the Bioware models and store them in the
current directory with the extension of &quot;.mdl&quot; instead of &quot;.mdl.ascii&quot;
as it normally would.</p>
<h3>NwnMdlComp Regression Tests</h3>
<p>To help insure that NwnMdlComp actually works as advertised, it has a series
of three regression tests that are run against all the binary models found in
the NWN data files.</p>
<p>The &quot;-t1&quot; regression tests performs a basic decompilation test of all the
binary models. Success is only determined by the lack of the program crashing.</p>
<p>The &quot;-t2&quot; regression test will decompile a model, then recompile the results,
then decompile the recompilation.&nbsp; The results of the two decompilation
phases are compared to see if they actually match.</p>
<p>The &quot;-t3&quot; regression test will decompile a model, then recompile the results,
generate internally the model output file, then decompile the recompilation.&nbsp;
The results of the two decompilation phases are compared to see if they actually
match.&nbsp; This is the strongest of all three tests since all phases of model
compilation and decompilation are tested.</p>
<p>The &quot;-t4&quot; regression test will perform the same tests as
&quot;-t3&quot;.&nbsp; However, it will also include smoothing data.&nbsp; This
test is known to generate errors.</p>
