How to install
--------------

1. Get hakpack latest release from [releases](https://github.com/ArmorDarks/completerc/releases) section
2. Unpack it somewhere
3. Copy `CompleteRC.hak` from `hak` directory to `Neverwinter Nights\hak` directory
4. Copy `*.erf` files from `erf` directory to `Neverwinter Nights\erf` directory


How to use
----------

If you're not familiar with Neverwinter Nights:

1. Get Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark 1.69 somewhere
2. Create your first character and play main campaign
3. Get addictive to NWN to the point when you will realize that you can't leave without NWN and you have strong urge to build  something cool with NWN Toolset. Then proceed to next part:

If you're familiar with Neverwinter Nights:

1. Launch NWN Toolset via `nwtoolset.exe`
2. Create new module or load already existing
3. Proceed to `Edit` > `Module Properties`
4. Switch to `Custom Content` tab
5. Select `completerc` from list and hit add. This will add new tileset
6. If you want hills without shadow issues, but with simpler curves — add `completercshr` and move it _above_ `completerc`
7. Hit `ok`
8. Proceed to `File` > `Import` and select four copied before to `erf` directory files. You will need to repeat it four times — for each file. It will load new placeables into palette.
9. You're ready to build!

To create new area which will use this tileset use `Wizards` > `Area Wizard` and during creation select `+ Complete Rural\City`

Hackpack-related placeables will appear in `Palette` > `Placeables` > `Custom` tab > `#Hackpack Placeables`.


Compatibility notes
-------------------

CompleteRC can be used as swap-in replacement of DOA City/Rural 2.1 + LOK XP1&2. If your areas have been built with DOA City/Rural 2.1 + LOK XP1&2, just remove it from hak-list and add `CompleteRC.hak`. That it.

Thanks to [virusman](https://github.com/virusman) for making it possible.


Known bug
---------

There is one bug with shadows of `Hills` terrain. It can't be seen in toolset, but if you'll look at location with `Hills` terrain in game, you might notice strange "shadow traces". Just run a bit around and probably you'll notice them.

Here are few screenshots with bug:

* http://data.virusman.ru/ax20/devs/ArmorDarks/CRC_shadowbug_h.jpg
* http://data.virusman.ru/ax20/devs/ArmorDarks/CRC_shadowbug_traces.jpg

Unfortunately I don't know how to fix it. Guys from CTP said that bug caused by too complex mesh.

For this moment there are only few solutions
  * Вon't use `Hills` terrain
  * Switch off shadows.
  * Use optional **simpler hills replacement pack**, described below.


Optional haks
-------------

### Simpler hills replacement pack

As was said above, original hills from Complete Rural\City, that were made by Zeon, causes shadow bugs.

Zeon's hills are much more realistic, more natural than Wayland Hills. Besides, they have advanced tiles for road, so you can place road anywhere on Zeon hills and it will look natural. However, not all people can stand shadow bugs they causing. And I'm no exception.

Since there are people that prefer to use more natural looking hills desipte shadow bugs, compromise was needed to solve that problem. So? I've made optional hakpack.

`Simpler hills replacement pack` contains Wayland Hills and will override hills of core CompleteRC hak. It _DOES NOT_ affect set file at all - only `mdl`s and `wok`s.

#### How to use

Put `CompleteRCshr.hak` above `CompleteRC.hak`. That's all

#### Caveats

All Zeon's hills tiles have few variations (usually 3-4 per tile). _This pack will replace only first variations and won't cut other variations_. Not big deal, but Waylandhills have completely other models and they won't fit Zeon's Hills — if you'll place Waylandhill and Zeon Hill close to each other you'll see white space because Zeon's hills a bit higher.

That means that:

1. After applying that pack you'll have to change each hills tile to it's first variant manually with `Erase` tool
2. You'll have to change high of placeable that were placed on hills, because Waylandhills have different shape


2do
---

This is list from my old notes. Not sure I will ever have time to fix those, but just in case — let's keep it here:

- [ ] fix water — it doesn't react on ambient light
- [ ] fix shadows
- [ ] fix stone bridge edge mdl — ends of birdge are missed
- [ ] remove dirty patch from stone bridge
- [ ] CCS wall —  add continuer for pillars
- [ ] CCS castle — add continuers for castle walls
- [ ] Buildings — add cobble continuer
