Compatibility notes
-------------------

This hak can be used Instead of DOA City/Rural 2.1 + LOK XP1&2. If your areas was build with DOA City/Rural 2.1 + LOK XP1&2, just remove it and add instead of it CompleteRC.hak. Thanks to [virusman](https://github.com/virusman) all should work properly

Known bug
---------

There is one bug with shadows of "hills" terrain. It can't be seen in toolset, but if you'll look at location with "hill" terrain in game, you'll see strange "shadow traces". They appear not always. Just run a bit around and probably you'll see anomaly shadows.

Here are screens with bug:

* http://data.virusman.ru/ax20/devs/ArmorDarks/CRC_shadowbug_h.jpg
* http://data.virusman.ru/ax20/devs/ArmorDarks/CRC_shadowbug_traces.jpg

Unfortunately I don't know how to fix it. Guys from CTP said that bug caused by too complex mesh.

For this moment there is only few solutions - don't use hill terrain or switch off shadow.

Also, you can use optional **simpler hills replacement pack**.


Optional haks
-------------

### Simpler hills replacement pack

As I said above, original hills from Complete Rural\City, that were made by Zeon, causing shadow bugs.

Zeon's hills much more realistic, more natural, they looks much better then Wayland Hills, they have advanced tiles for road, so you can place road anywhere on Zeon hills and it would look very well. However	not all people like bug which they causing. And I'm not exception. I don't like those shadows bugs at all.

Thus, there is people that don't care about such bugs and prefer to use more advanced hills such as Zeon's.

So, some compromise were needed to solve that problem. In result I've made optional simpler hills replacement pack.

It's very simple hak - it contain Wayland Hills and will override current hills in core CompleteRC hak. It _DOES NOT_ affect set file at all - only mdls and woks.

Yes, they are not so fantastic as Zeons, especially when things comes to road + hills, but instead they don't have that annoying bug with shadows.

HOWEVER there is one trouble with that replacement:

it will replace only first variation of each hills tiles.

Example: all Zeons Hills tiles have a few variation (around 3 or 4 edges, for example). But this replacement will replace only first variations and won't cut other variations. However, Waylandhills have completely other model and they won't fit Zeons Hills - if you place Waylandhill and Zeon Hill close to each other you'll see white space because Zeons hills a bit higher.

That means 2 things:

1. after applying that replace you'll have to change each hills tile to it's first variant manually
2. Waylandhills have different shape from Zeon's hills, so you'll have to change high of placeable that were placed on hills.

All that means that you'll have to choose what type of hills will you use - original, or simpler, and all players will be forced to use same type of hills too.

#### Why so complicated?

I didn't want to touch set file. In result that optional pack will be always compatible with core hak
and if core hak will be updated, that optional hak won't require update.

#### Installation
Just put CompleteRCshr.hak above CompleteRC.hak

- [ ] remove dirty patch from stone bridge
