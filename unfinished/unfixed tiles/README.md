Unfixed tiles
=============

_**Help wanted**_

That list I can't do by my self, becouse I am not a 3d modeller. Files, listed below, have to be remade to fit DOA titleset. Mostly becouse they are heigher than have to be

I hope someone will help me with this. I've put all files near that readme:

* `rns01_r01_017.mdl` — it this title water lower then have to be in DOA. I attached `tcr10_x04_01.mdl` as example of proper water height
* `rns01_r01_016.mdl` — height of cliff is more, then have to be to work proper in DOA. You can use `tcr10_x04_01.mdl` as example of proper cliff height
* `rns01_r01_053.mdl` — height of cliff is more, then have to be to work proper in DOA. You can use `tcr10_x04_01.mdl` as example of proper cliff height
* `tw010_h40_02.wok` — `tw010_h40_02.mdl` doesn't have any wok. If you look into wok, you'll see that it's empty
* `ttr01_swe_01.mdl` — height of cliff is more and height of water is lower than have to be to fit DOA titleset.
